# PFND3DDDI_SETRENDERSTATE callback



## -description
The <i>SetRenderState</i> function updates a render state.



## -prototype

````
PFND3DDDI_SETRENDERSTATE SetRenderState;

__checkReturn HRESULT APIENTRY SetRenderState(
  _In_       HANDLE                hDevice,
  _In_ const D3DDDIARG_RENDERSTATE *pData
)
{ ... }
````


## -parameters

### -param hDevice [in]

 A handle to the display device (graphics context).


### -param pData [in]

 A pointer to a <a href="display.d3dddiarg_renderstate">D3DDDIARG_RENDERSTATE</a> structure that describes how to update the render state.


## -returns
<i>SetRenderState</i> returns S_OK or an appropriate error result if the render state is not successfully updated.


## -remarks
The Microsoft Direct3D runtime maps <b>BeginScene</b> and <b>EndScene</b> calls from applications to the user-mode display driver's <i>SetRenderState</i> function. When the runtime receives a <b>BeginScene</b> call, it sets the <b>State</b> member of the <a href="display.d3dddiarg_renderstate">D3DDDIARG_RENDERSTATE</a> structure that is pointed to by <i>pData</i> to D3DRENDERSTATE_SCENECAPTURE and the <b>Value</b> member of D3DDDIARG_RENDERSTATE to <b>TRUE</b> and then calls <i>SetRenderState</i>. When the runtime receives an <b>EndScene</b> call, it sets the <b>State</b> member to D3DRENDERSTATE_SCENECAPTURE and the <b>Value</b> member to <b>FALSE</b> and then calls <i>SetRenderState</i>. In between these calls to <i>SetRenderState</i>, the driver captures geometric data within a frame.
